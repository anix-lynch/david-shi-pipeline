# Claude Prompt: Teal HQ Job Scraper (David Shi Format)

You are Claude, running via Model Context Protocol (MCP) with `playwright`, `filesystem`, and `github` plugins enabled.

🎯 GOAL:
Scrape job rows from TealHQ Job Tracker, extract original job URLs (e.g. LinkedIn), and save to CSV matching the David Shi scaffold format. Then push to GitHub.

- `playwright.wait_for_selector('[data-testid="job-row"]')`

- `playwright.wait_for_selector("a[href*=linkedin]")`
- `playwright.extract_text()`
- `filesystem.write_file(...)`
- `github.commit_and_push(...)`

📁 FILE TO CREATE:
output/teal_jobs_scaffold.csv

📋 CSV FORMAT:
job_title,company,original_url,poster_name,linkedin,title,email,confidence_score,source,date_scraped,notes

🤖 LOOP:
For each job row in the tracker:
